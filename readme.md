ToDo

- [X] try with multiple URLs (just no params)
- [X] get it onto Github pages
- [ ] get the 'save to home screen' icon working
- [ ] learn how to clear the cache on iOS. By removing the browser (last resort)?


Notes

- put every file under NETWORK as well as under CACHED
- once the html file is cached, how can I get it to reload changes to that html file?
